# CanSat Debug presentation and demos

This was a presentation held in Hungarian for the CanSat competition members on
- 01/03, 2025.
- 11/29, 2025.

The presentation was changed for the second one, and the examples were shortened
- though the readme of the examples won't show that, I just skipped some parts.

The projects are for Simplicity Studio v5, using Simplicity SDK 2024.12.0 and
BRD4204D boards.

**Note that all projects have bugs in them, that's the point.** See the
readme.md file on each project for details.
